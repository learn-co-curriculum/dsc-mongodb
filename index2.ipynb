    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we introduced the popular NoSQL database __MongoDB__. We executed CRUD operations on a sample dataset using __MongoDB Atlas__, a cloud-based service offered by MongoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will expand on your knowledge of MongoDB, cloud computing, and CRUD operations to manipulate data from a MongoDB Atlas database in a Jupyter notebook using the popular Python library, __Pymongo__. This is very similar to the way that sqlite3 allowed us to connect to and work with SQLite databases in previous lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder __CRUD__ operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_C_**reating a MongoDB database\n",
    "- **_R_**ead data from a MongoDB database\n",

In the previous we laid the foundation to do this by creating a MongoDB Atlas account and creating a cluster on a shared server. Then, we granted access permissions and downloaded our TLS certificate so that we can access the cluster from our local machine.\n",

    "We will connect to MongoDB Atlas using the following steps:\n",
